# Yass Reloaded Karaoke Editor
Yass Reloaded is a graphical editor for finetuning Ultrastar karaoke songs. 
You can drag & drop notes, spread syllables, and find errors. Further you can filter your song library, mass-tag or batch-correct them, or search for lyrics.

Yass Reloaded is a fork from Yass 2.4.3 that Saruta has been developing since 2009. Due to time constraints on his behalf and "creative differences" with the other contributors, I decided to go rogue with my fork.
